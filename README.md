# Clock Project with Theme Change

This project is a clock implemented using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- TypeScript (TS): A programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript.
- React Icons: An icon library for React.
- React Context API: A React API that allows data to be shared between components without having to manually pass props.
- useState: A React hook that allows adding state to functional components.

The main goal of this project is to create a clock that displays the current time and allows the user to change the theme of the page. Clicking a button will change the theme of the page, affecting the visual style of the clock and other UI elements.

This project uses the technologies mentioned above to create a modern and dynamic web application.
